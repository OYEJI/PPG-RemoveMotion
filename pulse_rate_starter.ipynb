When the blood returns to the heart there are fewer blood cells in the wrist. The PPG sensor emits a green light which can be absorbed by the red blood cells and the photodetector will see the various levels of blood flow in the reflected light. When the blood returns to the heart fewer blood cells can absorb the green light and the photo detector can see an increase in the reflected light.\n",
